# Patterns: Social Proof

Patterns for leveraging social influence to build trust and encourage action.

---

## What is Social Proof?

People look to others' behavior to guide their own decisions. When uncertain, we assume the crowd knows something we don't.

**Core principle:** Show users that others have chosen, trusted, and succeeded with your product.

---

## Testimonials & Reviews

**What:** Direct quotes from satisfied users.

### Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Quote testimonials** | Brand credibility, landing pages |
| **Star ratings** | Quick quality signal |
| **Written reviews** | Detailed feedback, product pages |
| **Video testimonials** | High-trust, emotional impact |
| **Case studies** | B2B, complex products |

### Psychological Principles

- **Social proof** — Others' positive experience signals quality
- **Authority** — Expert testimonials add credibility
- **Similarity** — Relatable testimonials more persuasive

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Real names, photos, roles (specific > anonymous)
- Include measurable results when possible
- Show diversity in testimonials
- Place near decision points (CTAs, pricing)
- Keep quotes concise and specific

**DON'T:**
- Fabricate testimonials (ever)
- Use generic/vague praise ("Great product!")
- Hide negative reviews entirely (looks suspicious)
- Overwhelm with too many testimonials
- Use testimonials without permission

### Testimonial Structure

```
"[Specific benefit achieved] since using [product]. 
[Quantifiable result if possible]."

— [Full Name], [Role] at [Company]
[Photo] [Logo optional]
```

## User-Generated Content (UGC)

**What:** Content created by users (photos, reviews, posts) displayed as social proof.

### Types

- Customer photos/videos using product
- Social media posts featuring product
- Community forum activity
- User-submitted tips/guides

### Benefits

- **Authenticity** — Real users, not marketing
- **Scale** — Users create content for you
- **Community** — Shows active user base
- **Trust** — Peer recommendations > brand claims

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Curate quality examples
- Credit creators
- Show recent activity (freshness matters)
- Include variety
- Make submission easy

**DON'T:**
- Display low-quality content
- Use without permission
- Fake UGC
- Show outdated content
- Over-moderate (loses authenticity)

## Activity & Usage Indicators

**What:** Showing aggregate user behavior as social signal.

### Types

| Indicator | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **User count** | "Join 50,000+ users" |
| **Activity count** | "2.5M projects created" |
| **Live activity** | "42 people viewing this" |
| **Popularity** | "Bestseller", "Trending" |
| **Engagement** | "10K+ likes" |

### Psychological Principles

- **Bandwagon effect** — Popular = good
- **FOMO** — Others are acting now
- **Trust numbers** — Large numbers = established

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use real, verifiable numbers
- Update numbers regularly
- Round for readability (50K not 49,847)
- Choose impressive metrics
- Place near CTAs

**DON'T:**
- Show embarrassingly low numbers
- Fabricate statistics
- Show stale data
- Over-precise numbers (looks fake)
- Show metrics that don't matter

### When to Show vs. Hide

**Show when:**
- Numbers are impressive
- Metric is relevant
- Adds credibility

**Hide when:**
- Numbers are low (new product)
- Metric is vanity
- Would cause FOMO negatively

## Trust Badges & Certifications

**What:** Third-party credibility signals.

### Types

| Badge Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Security** | SSL, payment security, privacy compliance |

| **Reviews** | G2, Capterra, TrustPilot ratings |

### Placement Guidelines

- **Security badges** — Near payment forms, account creation
- **Certifications** — Footer, pricing page, enterprise pages

- **Press logos** — Homepage, about page
- **Awards** — Wherever credibility needed

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use recognizable badges
- Link to verification where possible
- Keep current (expired certs = worse than none)
- Place near relevant decision points
- Limit quantity (3-5 max per area)

**DON'T:**
- Use fake/made-up badges
- Overwhelm with too many badges

- Place irrelevant badges

## Social Media Integration

**What:** Showing social media presence and activity.

### Types

- Follower counts
- Recent posts
- Share counters
- Social login options
- Embedded feeds

### Psychological Principles

- **Familiarity** — Platform logos provide comfort
- **Activity** — Active social presence = alive business

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**

- Use recognizable social icons

**DON'T:**

## Scarcity & Urgency

**What:** Social proof through limited availability or time pressure.

### Types

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Stock scarcity** | "Only 3 left in stock" |
| **Demand scarcity** | "12 people viewing this" |
| **Time urgency** | "Sale ends in 2:15:00" |
| **Social urgency** | "5 purchased in last hour" |

### Psychological Principles

- **Scarcity principle** — Less available = more valuable
- **Loss aversion** — Fear of missing out
- **Social proof** — Others want it too

### Implementation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use real scarcity data
- Be truthful about urgency
- Make scarcity relevant (matters for that product)
- Use sparingly for maximum impact

**DON'T:**
- Fake scarcity (destroys trust)
- Use constant urgency (loses impact)
- Create anxiety unnecessarily
- Use dark patterns (fake timers that reset)

### Warning

⚠️ Fake scarcity is a dark pattern. Users recognize it, and it destroys trust. Only use genuine scarcity signals.

## Recommendations & Similar Users

**What:** "People like you" suggestions.

### Types
