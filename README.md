## What is OpenWhale?

Other AI assistants chat. OpenWhale **does**. It deploys autonomous agent swarms that fan-out complex work to multiple AI agents running in parallel, coordinate them with shared memory and file locks, and collect results automatically. Connect it to 8 AI providers, let it talk on your behalf through WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Twitter/iMessage, browse the web with real browser automation, execute code, manage your calendar, send emails — and basically run your digital life.

**An AI workforce, not just an AI assistant.** One agent is nice. A coordinated swarm is unstoppable.

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Coordination

Deploy **multiple AI agents in parallel** to tackle complex tasks faster. Automatic task decomposition, shared context, advisory file locks, and inter-agent messaging.

```
"Research quantum computing and write a Python sorting algorithm"
     → Orchestrator fans out to Research Agent + Coder Agent
     → Results synthesized automatically
```

- **Fan-out / Fan-in** — Split work across specialized parallel agents
- **Shared Context** — Agents share data via a namespaced key-value store
- **Active Locks** — Advisory file locks prevent concurrent write conflicts
- **Inter-Agent Messaging** — Agents can talk to each other during execution
- **A2A Protocol** — Google Agent2Agent protocol for interop with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen

> 📖 **[Multi-Agent Documentation →](docs/multi-agent.md)**

### 🌐 Browser Automation

Two backends to choose from:

| Backend | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Playwright** | Simple scraping, headless automation, zero setup |
| **BrowserOS** | Real browser with your extensions, cookies, and logins |

BrowserOS lets the AI control YOUR actual browser — including logged-in sessions, AdBlock, 1Password, and everything else.

> 📖 **[Browser Automation Guide →](docs/browser-automation.md)**

---

### ⚡ Self-Extension System

The AI can create its own automations. Just ask.

- *"Create an extension that checks Bitcoin price every hour and sends it to WhatsApp"*
- *"Make an extension that reminds me to drink water"*
- *"Create a daily standup summary extension"*

Extensions support cron scheduling, multi-channel output, and persist across restarts.

> 📖 **[Extensions Documentation →](docs/extensions.md)**

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/extensions.png" alt="Extensions" width="600" />
</p>

---

### 🧠 Persistent Memory

Remembers everything, even after restarts: long-term facts, daily notes, vector search (local embeddings, no API needed!), and session persistence.

> 📖 **[Memory System →](docs/memory.md)**

---

### 💓 Heartbeat (Proactive Agent)

The AI wakes up periodically to check on things — configurations, inboxes, tasks — without you having to ask.

> 📖 **[Heartbeat Documentation →](docs/heartbeat.md)**

---

### 🔒 Enterprise Security

JWT authentication, rate limiting, audit logs, sandboxed code execution, command filtering, multi-user support.

> 📖 **[Security Documentation →](docs/security.md)**

---

### 🐋 macOS Native App

Native SwiftUI menu bar app with quick chat, status monitoring, and channel controls — no browser needed.

> 📖 **[macOS App Documentation →](docs/macos-app.md)**
